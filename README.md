Through this project, I gained experience in building a compact and responsive profile card component. Some key takeaways include:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the card is fully responsive and looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Utilized Flexbox to align and structure the card elements for a clean and flexible layout.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Used CSS variables to manage color schemes and spacings, making the design easy to maintain and adjust.
- **HTML5 Semantics**: Improved the structure and accessibility of the component by applying semantic HTML.
